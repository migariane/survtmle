\description{
A dataset containing data that is similar in structure to the 
RTSS/AS01 malaria vaccine trial. Privacy agreements prevent the sharing
of the real data, so please note THAT THIS IS NOT THE REAL RTSS,S DATA.
The data set is a \code{list} of 10 simulated multiple outputation draws.
The covariate data, \code{ftime}, and \code{vaccine} stay the same across
the data sets; however, the \code{ftype} variable changes, simulating 
outputed data sets of multiply infected trial participants.
